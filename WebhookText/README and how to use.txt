   ** WebhookText README **

Thank you for downloading this app, its really
useful for automation as you can edit the code
so it sends a message on startup, anyway

There are 2 variants:

Variant 1: You will have to edit the file,
but its a one-time thing only.

Variant 2: There is no need to edit,
but each time you will have to paste the 
Webhook URL on startup.

!! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART !!
DO NOT SHARE YOUR WEBHOOK URL, SOMEONE
CAN LOG INTO THE BOT AND TAKE OVER 
YOUR SERVER, SO PLEASE BE CAREFULL.
            Thank you.
